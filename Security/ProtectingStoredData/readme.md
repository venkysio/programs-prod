As in any application, data is the most important thing that is to be protected against many attacks.
When the data is stored, the security issues that can occur on it include:

1.  Access permissions:
  
  In Windows, Windows Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to maintain the access information. But the usage of ACL's is complex and not implementing them accurately may lead to drastic vulnerabilities.
  In Unix or MAC OS the access permissions are mainted by user-group-others bits making it simpler.But compressing complex problems into simpler solutions may not be always accurate.

2. Inappropriate access controls:

    Most of the attacks occur when all the users are granted all the permissions to do anything in the system.
    The reverse of this i.e, restricting every user is also equally sinful.
 
3. Weak encryption:

Redemption:
Donâ€™t use lousy permissions or ACLs and encrypt data correctly.
