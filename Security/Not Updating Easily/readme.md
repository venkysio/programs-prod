Most software needs to be updated at some point during the supported lifespan,
whether this is for a bug fix, for a service pack, as a minor update, or to fix a security bug

Different types of applications have different updating needs. 

The sins related to updation of appications are:
- sinful installation of additional software
   Users install updates to fix problems with the software they have, not to install more software, which could have problems of its own. 
- sinful access controls
- sinful prompt fatigue
- sinful ignorance
- sinfully updating without notifying
- sinfully updating one system at a time
- sinfully forcing reboot
