Password in internet is a highly used entity for authentication.
There is an ever running trade off between its goodness and ease of use.
Any software system using passwords is a security risk. Managing passwords poorly can make the overall problem even
worse, but there are ways to deal with passwords correctly that can mitigate many of the
problems with a weak authentication mechanism that we seem to be stuck with.

There are many problems that a password based system suffers. Some of them are:
1.  Password Compromise: Passwords are a portable, single-factor authentication method, user can be tricked into revealing a password.
2.  Weak passwords and iterated passwords: A weak password allows an attacker to easily guess the userâ€™s password.
3.  Infrequent password changes: If password changes are not required, the obvious consequence is that any compromised passwords will remain compromised indefinitely.
4.  Default passwords: The default passwords that are provided to users are common irrespective of the user and can be easily cracked.
5.  Replay Attacks: A replay attack happens when someone is able to obtain the network traffic between the user and server application, and is then able to just send the packets again and obtain the same access your user would have.
6.  Password storage and brute force: When passwords are directly stored,
