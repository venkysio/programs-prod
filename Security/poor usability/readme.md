Everyone is a user, and everyone more or less knows what is easy for them to use.

Software designers often implicitly make the assumption that whatever they find usable other people will find usable. 

The first principle of building usable, secure systems is that “designers are not users.”

Security is never the user’s priority. All users will say they want security, but they’ll be willing to forego it at a moment’s
notice if it gets in the way of what they’re doing.

Another common problem is that, when security crosses paths with the users, designers
often fail to make things obvious and easy. This leaves users frustrated, and they’ll then
often look for ways to game the system to avoid such frustrations.

Two major user groups end users and administrators must be considered while thinking about security and usability

Administrators want to make sure they can manage the computer systems under their direct control, and consumers want to
be safe online.

End users really don’t make good security decisions, regardless of how much information you put in front of them.

The properties of security related text can be:
  - Too little appropriate information
  - Too much information
  - Too many messages
  - Inaccurate or generic information
  - Errors with only error codes
Redemption steps:
- When Users Are Involved, Make the UI Simple and Clear
- Make Security Decisions for Users
- Move Over Stick; Bring On the Carrot
- Make Selective Relaxation of Security Policy Easy
- Clearly Indicate Consequences
